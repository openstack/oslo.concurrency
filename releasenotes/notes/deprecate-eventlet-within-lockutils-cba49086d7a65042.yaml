deprecations:

    Eventlet usages are deprecated and the removal of Eventlet from
    OpenStack `is planned <https://governance.openstack.org/tc//goals/proposed/remove-eventlet.html>`_,
    for this reason, using the ``lockutils`` module of oslo.concurrency in a
    monkey patched environment is now deprecated. The support of Eventlet will
    be soon removed from oslo.concurrency.

    Please start considering removing your internal Eventlet usages and
    start migrating your stack.
