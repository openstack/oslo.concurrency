    The returned list includes all oslo.config options which may be registered

    Each element of the list is a tuple. The first element is the name of the
    group under which the list of elements in the second element will be

    This function is also discoverable via the 'oslo_concurrency' entry point

    The purpose of this is to allow tools like the Oslo sample config file
    generator to discover the options exposed to users by this library.
